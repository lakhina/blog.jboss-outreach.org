Contributing to open source can be exciting as well as scary at the same time. If you are a newbie, then entering into the world of open source can be a really overwhelming experience for sure. 

The term **"open source"** refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. Open source software is software developed by and for the user community. If you want to contribute to open source projects then **GitHub** is the next thing you need to be familiar with.

For contributing to open source, you don’t need to be a developer. A non-programmer can also do a variety of stuffs like documentation , designing and suggesting features.

Documentation plays a vital role in understanding of the project. Every project repository in GitHub comes with a **README** file stating how to use the project and how to set up the environment for running it. 

## How to contribute to open source?
*	Choose a project meeting your requirement and skill set.
*	Pick an issue to work upon or raise an issue if you find some bug in the project
*	After fixing the problem highlighted in the issue, open a pull request for it.
*	If your pull request need to be worked on further, then it’s  better to write *WIP* [work in progress] 
*	Try following the guidelines while submitting a patch

##### Easy! Isn’t it? 
After following these  little steps, you can congratulate yourself. You have now contributed to open source which felt terrifying in the beginning. 

This is an amazing experience to get to know that a project you worked on is now being used by millions of users. Moreover, you get a chance to interact with other people of your domain. You can learn from them and improve to an extend you have not anticipated. *So get , set and start contributing!!*
